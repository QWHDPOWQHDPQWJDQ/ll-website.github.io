            <p class="title">> Information</p>
            <p>Why did we choose <b>Vlogging?</b> We choose vlogging for several different reasons:</p>
            <br>
            <li><b>Behind-the-Scenes Access</b> -  Vlogging will allow us to take our audience on a journey, showing them the planning, preparation, and execution of our event. This gives them a deeper understanding of the effort and passion behind our cause.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Human Connection</b> - Vlogs are personal and authentic. We can share our group's enthusiasm, challenges, and triumphs, creating a stronger connection with your viewers. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Engagement</b> -  Vlogs encourage interaction. We can ask viewers questions, respond to comments, and even create polls or challenges related to our fundraising event.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Visual Storytelling</b> - Vlogs are a powerful medium for storytelling. We can use visuals, music, and editing to make our event come alive and capture the emotions of the experience.</li>
            <br>
            <p>Why did we <b>vlog</b> our journey? The reason we vlog our journey is because we'd like to reach our target audience and to show them why we do what we do.</p>

            <p>Why did we choose our target audience? One of the reasons we choose teens is because they're usually on the internet and they also have friends and family that they can vlog with.
